# Students churn prediction 

This program helps predict how many students will participate in academic activities based on certain demographic variables. 

The variables are:

    - Motivation
    - Age 
    -Gender
    -If he or she has been exposed to the subject matter
    -Country of origin
    -Days passed between registration and first day of class

This is a typical case of classification over imbalanced dataset so several ways to solve the problem is exposed. 

In the jupyter notebook you will find:
- Cleaning of the dataset 
- Variables pre processing
- Testing of various solutions to the imbalanced problem
- Baseline architecture and grid search over multiple parameters until reaching an optimal solution
For example: (learning rate, optimizer, number of neurons, dropout, etc.)
- Some conclusions (in Spanish)
